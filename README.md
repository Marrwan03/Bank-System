🏦 I built this system when i was learning C++
Bank System, System to do any operation in your Bank Account.

🎯 it has more security for Password because i use encryption so you have to be ok
when you do your operation that`s for user but the developer it`s good way to update code
because i build this system using OOP.

📢 if you want to transactions and change currency
you have to use this system it`s easy use and clear.

🛠️ Features are in this system:
1️⃣-Client:
it has the main operation for client like {Add, delete, find, update} and list all clients.

2️⃣-Users:
it has the main operation for userlike {Add, delete, find, update} and list all User.

3️⃣-Currency:

5️⃣-Transactions:
i build the ATM system and it did Deposite and Withdraw i see this system it`s good here
because i have account balance so i added this system here with some add like TransferLog
inside it you can show ant transfer with date and sender Info and recipient Info.

⌨️ i used C++ to build this system and OOP nothing for sql i use the right data structure 
to save and update from the file.

🗒️ as you know any system like that you have to own db but in the last time  i didn`t know
more about db and i choice the file to do my OP so i want to build this system in C# and save the data in db not file.
