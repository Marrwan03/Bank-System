# Bank-System
I built this system when i was learning C++
Bank System, System to do any operation in your Bank Account 

it hasmore security for Password because i use encryption so you have to be ok
when you do your operation that`s for user but the developer it`s good way to update code
because i build this system using OOP

if you want to transactions and change currency
you have to use this system it`s easy use and clear

Features are in this system:
 -Client:
it has the main operation for client like {Add, delete, find, update} and list all clients

-Users:
it has the main operation for userlike {Add, delete, find, update} and list all User

-Currency:
that is about change or know your Country's Currency opposite any Currency 
and you can find,Update Currency with list of all currencies and about
Currency Calculator that`s good feature in the currenct exchange because it`s good
when you want to know about the other currency By Your currency i set example
about that show it

-Login Register:
any user log in the system you can show him with the date and time

-Transactions:
i build the ATM system and it did Deposite and Withdraw i see this system it`s good here
because i have account balance so i added this system here with some add like TransferLog
inside it you can show ant transfer with date and sender Info and recipient Info

i used C++ to build this system and OOP nothing for sql i use the right data structure 
to save and update from the file

as you know any system like that you have to own db but in the last time  i didn`t know
more about db and i choice the file to do my OP

i want to build this system in C# and save the data in db not file

in the end if you want some details about this game ask me
